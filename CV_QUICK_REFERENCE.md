## üîç What Interviewers Might Ask

### Expected Questions & Honest Answers:

**Q: "Did you deploy the backend to production?"**
- ‚úÖ Honest: "We architected the backend structure and implemented the core logic, but focused on delivering a working frontend demo for the hackathon."

**Q: "How did you implement Redis?"**
- ‚úÖ Honest: "I designed the caching architecture with Redis in mind and added it to the requirements, but the full integration was scoped for post-hackathon work."

**Q: "Was it actually a microservice architecture?"**
- ‚úÖ Honest: "I integrated the AI as a server-side component using Next.js server actions with Google Genkit, which provided the same functionality without the overhead of separate services."

**Q: "What actually worked at the end of the hackathon?"**
- ‚úÖ Honest: "The complete frontend with all pages and UI, the DP optimization algorithm, and the AI chatbot integration. The backend was architected but not fully connected due to time constraints."

## üö® Red Flags to Avoid

**DON'T say:**
- ‚ùå "Built complete end-to-end real-time system" (backend not fully operational)
- ‚ùå "Node.js microservice" (it's not a separate service)
- ‚ùå "Production-ready backend" (missing integration layer)
- ‚ùå "Implemented Redis" (architecture designed but not verified)

**DO say:**
- ‚úÖ "Architected backend system"
- ‚úÖ "Integrated AI using Genkit framework"
- ‚úÖ "Delivered working prototype with functional components"
- ‚úÖ "Designed Redis caching architecture" (if you want to mention it)

## üéØ Final Recommendation

**Overall Confidence Score: 7/10**

Your project demonstrates strong technical skills. The main adjustment needed is changing "built" to "architected" for backend components that aren't fully integrated, and correcting the "microservice" terminology.

**Best Practice:** Update your CV to one of the recommended versions above, and you'll have an accurate, impressive, and defensible project description.
